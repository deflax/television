# Hypercorn configuration for Replay HLS streaming service
#
# VLC's HTTP/2 HLS demuxer has known stream cancellation bugs when
# multiplexing playlist + segment requests on the same connection,
# resulting in "Cancellation (0x8)" and "Stream closed (0x5)" errors.

# Limit HTTP/2 to 1 concurrent stream — this forces sequential requests
# just like HTTP/1.1, preventing the multiplexing-related cancellations.
# VLC will still connect via h2c but won't be able to open parallel streams.
h2_max_concurrent_streams = 1

# Keep connections alive to reduce reconnection overhead per segment
keep_alive_timeout = 30
